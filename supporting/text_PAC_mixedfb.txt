
> If the surface is in between the two, the redox mediator may be regenerated as in its original form as in positive feedback, but the rate at which this regeneration occurs is under kinetic rather than diffusion control. The approach curve may be fit in order to extract a kinetic rate constant (non-normalized k, or normalized kappa, where kappa = k*a/D), which is an indirect indicator of surface reactivity. This is referred to as mixed kinetics.
