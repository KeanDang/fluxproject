
About feedback mode imaging:

When positioned close to a surface (typically within one probe radius or smaller), the current measured at a microelectrode depends not only on the geometry of the probe and nature of the imaging solution, but also the characteristics of the surface.

In 2D scan patterns such as raster, zigzag, or spiral, the electrode is moved in the x and y directions (constant z, variable tip-substrate distance) and the currents measured are a convolution of topography and reactivity. In 3D scan patterns such as hopping or shear force, the electrode is moved in the x, y, and z directions (variable z, constant tip-substrate distance) and the currents measured are dependent only on the reactivity of the surface.

In both 2D and 3D scan patterns, the current-position relationship is used to build up an image of the reactivity of the surface over a larger region. A contrast in reactivity can be used to characterize notable features on the surface.
